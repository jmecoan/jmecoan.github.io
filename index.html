        <h3>Monyca Eleogram</h3>
        <p> Monyca remembers calling her home break in Hana the "mysterious beyond," because she never seemed to make it to the lineup. Many years and accomplishments later, Monyca has undoubtedly "made it". At fourteen, Monyca's athleticism culminated, and she solidified her place in the professional world of surfing. She represented Hawaii at the '05 and '06 Quiksilver World Junior Pro and qualified for the 2007 NSSA National Finals.</p>

        <img src="img/Kelia.jpg" alt="Generic placeholder image" width="240" height="140">
        <h3>Kelia Moniz</h3>
        <p>With 2 world championship titles, Kelia is one of the most graceful, carefree, and above all, versatile surfers in the world. She's equally fluid off the lip or cross-stepping to the nose; whether she's longboarding or shortboarding. As a grom, Kelia and her four brothers were dropped off at Waikiki early in the morning and didn't get picked up 'til sundown. By fourteen, she was not only competing against the world's best in longboarding, but also beating them.</p>

        <h3>Rosy Hodge</h3>
        <p>It took Rosanne Hodge only one year to qualify for the 2007 ASP Women's World Tour after graduating from high school. With an upbringing on the right-hand point breaks of east South Africa, it's no wonder she can execute one of the best layback snaps in women's surfing. At age 11, Rosy took 4th place in the U10 Boys division of the South African champs, and she competed on her national U19 team for the Quiksilver World Grommet Teams Title in Bali. Then she hit the ground running.</p>

        <img src="img/Bruna.jpg" alt="Generic placeholder image" width="240" height="140">
        <h3>Bruna Schmitz</h3>
        <p>
Bruna Schmitz turns heads both in and out of the water. Her big backhand hits and stylish forehand snaps equally match her natural, Brazilian poise as a model. She put in two years on the elite World Tour in 2009 and 2010, and Sports Illustrated showcased her beauty in the 2011 Swimsuit Issue. Bruna grew up surfing a long, right hand wave in the small town of Matinhos, Brazil. By the age of 14, Bruna was already the youngest athlete to win a professional event in Brazil.</p>

        <p class="lead">After finishing last season at No. 2 in the world, Tyler Wright (AUS) had a rough series of results in 2015. By September, after she lost in Round 4 at the Cascais Women's Pro, she admitted that she was ready to get focused in a new way. At the very next event, the Roxy Pro France, it was clear that she had meant it: She won the contest for the second consecutive year, and her result moved her two spots higher on the Jeep Leaderboard in the process.</p>

A thousand girls took to their yoga mats alongside ROXY team riders Kelia, Monyca, Bruna, Justine, Mainei, Alyssa, Caroline, Nao and Sophia as Stephanie Gilmore was paddling out for her first heat in the 2016 Women’s Championship tour.</p>
